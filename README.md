# Smooth CV by Appidea.pl

SmoothCV is a simple, wysiwyg and drag-drop CV creator with possibility of creating, editing, saving and importing CV.

That's fully React application based on create-react-app boilerplate, uses Redux to manage the state.

This example shows, how powerful is Redux - I managed to create that app in ~1 week, only because of this Redux incredible powerfulness! :)
